Q: How to create folder in github.com repository?

A: To create a new folder in github.com repository and add files in that folder:
-> github doesn't store empty folders. Just make sure there's a file in the folder
like : "scr/MovingAllFiles.txt" (after the name project : "pixeditor" + "/src/MovingAllFiles.txt") 
and clic on the button "Commit new file" and the folder will be added to your repository.
